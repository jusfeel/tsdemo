/** 
 * In JavaScript, this is a variable thatâ€™s set when a function is called. 
 * This makes it a very powerful and flexible feature, but it comes at the 
 * cost of always having to know about the context that a function is 
 * executing in. This is notoriously confusing, especially when returning 
 * a function or passing a function as an argument.
